1. Supported SSH key formats
With a secure shell pair you can create vm's that use SSH for authentication.
vm's created with SSH are by default configured with password disabled, this makes brute force attacks difficult. 
You can use `ssh-keygen` command to create SSH keys. By default the key are stored in a file located in the ~/.ssh directory.
You can specify a different location and optional passphrase to access the private key

2. Create an SSH key pair
-   command:ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096
-   description: this command creates a key pai with rsa encryption and a bit length of 4096


3. Provide an SSH public key when deploying a VM
First i had to create a resource group
-   terminal response
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/9ec2ae79-d576-4a9d-9224-b32e5d0bb930/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup",
  "location": "eastus",
  "managedBy": null,
  "name": "myResourceGroup",
  "properties": {
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded"
  },
  "tags": null,
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups"
}
Create vm with SSH key
-   command:az vm create   --resource-group myResourceGroup   --name myVM   --image UbuntuLTS   --admin-username azureuser   --ssh-key-values ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
-   terminal response
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/9ec2ae79-d576-4a9d-9224-b32e5d0bb930/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "eastus",
  "macAddress": "00-22-48-1E-88-C5",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "20.25.116.229",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup",
  "zones": ""
}



4. SSH into your VM
-   terminal response
{
    The authenticity of host '20.25.116.229 (20.25.116.229)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:BcNk0XOe8BS4lJvV76DLqV7JAr6S7wA27NdmLO/J4ag.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '20.25.116.229' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
